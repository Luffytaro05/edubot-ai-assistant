## 📊 Implementation Summary

### What Was Built

An enhanced "Reset Context" feature that allows students to reset their chatbot conversation context **per office**, maintaining isolation between different office conversations.

### Key Features

✅ **Office-Specific Reset** - Reset individual office contexts without affecting others  
✅ **Context Isolation** - Each office maintains independent conversation state  
✅ **Seamless Switching** - Users can switch between offices without losing context  
✅ **Smart Detection** - Automatic office detection from user messages  
✅ **Full Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Backend (`chat.py`) - 5 Major Changes

**Change 1: Enhanced Context Storage**
```python
# Before: Single context per user
user_contexts = {"user_id": "office_tag"}

# After: Multi-office structure
user_contexts = {
    "user_id": {
        "current_office": "admission_office",
        "offices": {
            "admission_office": {...},
            "registrar_office": {...}
        }
    }
}
```

**Change 2: New Helper Functions**
- `get_user_current_office(user_id)` - Get active office
- `set_user_current_office(user_id, office_tag)` - Set active office
- Enhanced `reset_user_context(user_id, office=None)` - Office-specific reset

**Change 3: Updated All Context Access**
- Line 312: `save_message()` function
- Line 591-593: Office detection logic
- Line 601: Context switching
- Line 610: Current context retrieval
- Line 657: Office context setting
- Line 661: Generic context reset
- Line 705: Vector search context

### 2. Backend API (`app.py`) - 1 Change

**Enhanced `/reset_context` Endpoint**
```python
POST /reset_context
Request: { "user": "TCC-0001", "office": "ict_office" }
Response: {
    "status": "Context reset successfully for ict_office",
    "user": "TCC-0001",
    "office": "ict_office",
    "context_cleared": true
}
```

### 3. Frontend (`static/app.js`) - 2 Changes

**Updated Both `resetContext()` Methods**

Method 1 (Line 599): Simple reset with backend sync
Method 2 (Line 1081): Enhanced reset with user feedback

Key additions:
- Office tag mapping (frontend → backend)
- Current office detection before reset
- Office-specific success messages
- Improved error handling

### 4. UI (`templates/base.html`) - No Changes Required ✅

The existing "Switch Topic" button already works perfectly:
```html
<button class="context-reset" onclick="resetContext()">Switch Topic</button>
```

## 🧪 Test Results

### Test Suite: `test_office_context_reset.py`

**Verification:**
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe test_office_context_reset.py
# Output: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

## 📋 User Scenarios

### Scenario A: Student with Multiple Office Inquiries

1. **Student asks about enrollment** → Admission Office context created
2. **Student asks about WiFi password** → ICT Office context created  
3. **Student clicks "Switch Topic" in ICT chat** → Only ICT reset
4. **Student returns to Admission** → Previous conversation intact ✅

### Scenario B: Fresh Start for Specific Office

1. **Student has long conversation with Registrar**
2. **Student wants to start fresh with Registrar**
3. **Student clicks "Switch Topic"** → Registrar context reset
4. **Other office conversations preserved** ✅

### Scenario C: Clean Slate (All Offices)

1. **Student has conversations with multiple offices**
2. **Backend performs full reset** (no office param)
3. **All office contexts cleared** → Fresh start everywhere

## 🔍 How to Test Manually

### Browser Testing

1. **Open the chatbot**
2. **Send message:** "I need help with enrollment"
   - Verify: Context shows "Admission Office"
3. **Send message:** "I forgot my WiFi password"
   - Verify: Context switches to "ICT Office"
4. **Click "Switch Topic" button**
   - Verify: Message shows "ICT Office context has been reset"
5. **Switch back to admission topic**
   - Verify: Previous conversation is maintained

### API Testing

```bash
# Test office-specific reset
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/reset_context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user": "test-user", "office": "ict_office"}'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "status": "Context reset successfully for ict_office",
#   "user": "test-user",
#   "office": "ict_office",
#   "context_cleared": true
# }
```
