# Enhanced Office-Specific Context Reset Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The EduChat AI Chatbot now supports **office-specific context reset functionality**, allowing users to reset their conversation context for individual offices while preserving other office conversations.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Context Storage Structure** (`chat.py`)

The context storage has been upgraded from a simple single-context model to a multi-office structure:

```python
# OLD Structure (Before):
user_contexts = {
    "TCC-0001": "admission_office"  # Single office context
}

# NEW Structure (After):
user_contexts = {
    "TCC-0001": {
        "current_office": "admission_office",
        "offices": {
            "admission_office": {"messages": [], "last_intent": None},
            "registrar_office": {"messages": [], "last_intent": None},
            "ict_office": {"messages": [], "last_intent": None},
            # ... other offices
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **New Helper Functions** (`chat.py`)

Added utility functions for managing office contexts:

- **`get_user_current_office(user_id)`** - Returns the current active office for a user
- **`set_user_current_office(user_id, office_tag)`** - Sets the current office and initializes its context
- **`reset_user_context(user_id, office=None)`** - Enhanced to support office-specific reset

### 3. **Updated Backend Endpoint** (`app.py`)

The `/reset_context` endpoint now accepts an optional `office` parameter:

```python
POST /reset_context
{
    "user": "TCC-0001",
    "office": "admission_office"  // Optional: specific office to reset
}
```

**Behavior:**
- If `office` is provided: Resets only that specific office's context
- If `office` is `None`: Resets all contexts for the user (full reset)

### 4. **Enhanced Frontend** (`static/app.js`)

The `resetContext()` function now:
- Detects the current active office
- Sends office-specific reset request to backend
- Shows office-specific confirmation messages
- Maintains isolation between different office conversations

```javascript
// Automatically sends the current office when resetting
fetch('/reset_context', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
        user: this.user,
        office: currentOfficeTag  // e.g., 'admission_office'
    })
})
```

## 📋 How It Works

### User Journey Example:

1. **Student chats with Registrar's Office**
   - Context is set to `registrar_office`
   - Conversation history is maintained

2. **Student switches to ICT Office**
   - Context switches to `ict_office`
   - Previous Registrar conversation is preserved

3. **Student clicks "Reset Context" while in ICT**
   - **Only** ICT Office context is reset
   - Registrar's Office conversation remains intact
   - Student can continue ICT conversation fresh

4. **Student switches back to Registrar's Office**
   - Previous conversation with Registrar is still available
   - No data was lost when ICT was reset

---

## 🏢 Supported Offices

The feature supports all five office contexts:

| Office Tag | Display Name |
|-----------|--------------|
| `admission_office` | Admission Office |
| `registrar_office` | Registrar's Office |
| `ict_office` | ICT Office |
| `guidance_office` | Guidance Office |
| `osa_office` | Office of Student Affairs |

## ✅ Testing Results

All tests passed successfully! ✨

```
============================================================
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED SUCCESSFULLY!
============================================================

🎉 Office-specific context reset is working correctly!
Each office maintains its own isolated context.
Resetting one office does not affect others.
```

### Test Coverage:

✅ **Test 1:** Office context structure initialization  
✅ **Test 2:** Multiple office contexts simultaneously  
✅ **Test 3:** Office-specific reset isolation  
✅ **Test 4:** Current office tracking and switching  
✅ **Test 5:** Full context reset (all offices)  
✅ **Test 6:** Resetting non-existent office (error handling)

---

## 🚀 Usage

### For Students:

1. Start chatting with any office (e.g., "I need help with enrollment" → Admission Office)
2. The chatbot will remember your conversation context
3. If you want to start fresh with that office:
   - Click the **"Switch Topic"** button in the context indicator
   - Only that office's conversation will reset
4. Switch to another office - your previous conversations are preserved

### For Developers:

#### Reset Specific Office Context:
```python
from chat import reset_user_context

# Reset only ICT office for user TCC-0001
reset_user_context("TCC-0001", "ict_office")
```

#### Reset All Contexts:
```python
# Reset all offices for user TCC-0001
reset_user_context("TCC-0001")
```

#### Get Current Office:
```python
from chat import get_user_current_office

current = get_user_current_office("TCC-0001")
# Returns: 'admission_office' or None
```

#### Set Office Context:
```python
from chat import set_user_current_office

set_user_current_office("TCC-0001", "registrar_office")
```

## 🎨 User Interface

The context reset button appears when an office context is active:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Currently helping with: ICT Office      │
│ [Switch Topic] ← Resets only ICT        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```
✅ ICT Office context has been reset. 
   You can continue with a fresh conversation.
```
