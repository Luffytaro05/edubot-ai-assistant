## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: User Submits Feedback
```
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars)
Comment: "Excellent service! Very helpful and quick responses."
```

### Step 2: Automatic Analysis
```python
# System analyzes using VADER
sentiment, scores = analyze_sentiment(5, "Excellent service! Very helpful...")

# Results:
sentiment = "positive"
scores = {
    "compound": 0.911,   # 91.1% positive overall
    "pos": 0.623,        # 62.3% positive words
    "neu": 0.377,        # 37.7% neutral words
    "neg": 0.000         # 0% negative words
}
```

### Step 3: Stored in Database
```json
{
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Excellent service! Very helpful...",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "sentiment_scores": {
    "compound": 0.911,
    "pos": 0.623,
    "neu": 0.377,
    "neg": 0.000
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T10:30:00"
}
```

### Step 4: Displayed to Admin
```
Sentiment: 😊 Positive
[Hover to see: VADER Analysis: Overall 91.1%, Positive 62.3%, Neutral 37.7%, Negative 0%]
```
