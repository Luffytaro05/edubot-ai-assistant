# MongoDB Announcements Integration Summary

## Overview
The chatbox announcements panel (`chatbox__announcements`) now exclusively displays announcements from MongoDB collections, specifically from the sub-announcements and admin-announcements managed through the Sub-announcements.html page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`chat.py`)

**File:** `chat.py`

**Modified Function:** `get_active_announcements()`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed JSON file fallback - now uses **MongoDB only**
- ✅ Enhanced announcement data with additional fields:
  - `end_date` - Display date ranges for announcements
  - `office` - Show which office created the announcement
  - `created_by` - Show who posted the announcement
  - `source` - Distinguish between sub_admin and admin announcements

**Data Sources:**
- `sub_announcements` collection (created via Sub-announcements.html)
- `admin_announcements` collection (created by admins)

### 2. Frontend Changes (`static/app.js`)

**File:** `static/app.js`

**Modified Function:** `renderAnnouncements()`

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Display **date ranges** (start_date - end_date) instead of just start date
- ✅ Show **office badges** indicating which office posted the announcement
- ✅ Show **source badges** distinguishing between Admin and Sub-Admin announcements
- ✅ Display **author information** showing who posted the announcement
- ✅ Better metadata organization with flexible layout

**Modified Function:** `loadAnnouncements()`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded fallback announcements
- ✅ Now shows empty state if MongoDB is unavailable or has no announcements

### 3. Styling Changes (`static/style.css`)

**File:** `static/style.css`

**New CSS Classes:**
- `.announcement-meta` - Container for date, office, and source badges
- `.announcement-office` - Blue badge showing the office (e.g., "Admission", "Registrar")
- `.announcement-source` - Purple badge showing source (Admin/Sub-Admin)
- `.announcement-author` - Italicized text showing who posted the announcement

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Sub-Admin creates announcement** in `Sub-announcements.html`:
   - Saves to MongoDB `sub_announcements` collection
   - Also mirrors to `admin_announcements` collection for visibility

2. **Backend endpoint** (`/announcements`):
   - Calls `get_active_announcements()` function
   - Fetches all active announcements from both MongoDB collections
   - Sorts by priority (High → Medium → Low) then by date

3. **Frontend chatbox**:
   - Loads announcements when chatbox initializes
   - Refreshes when user clicks the announcements button
   - Renders with enhanced display showing all metadata

### Announcement Display Format

Each announcement now shows:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title                          [HIGH]        │
│ 📅 2025-01-15 - 2025-01-30  Admission SubAdmin│
│ Description of the announcement...           │
│ Posted by: John Doe                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Benefits

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: All announcements come from MongoDB  
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Announcements created in Sub-announcements.html appear immediately  
✅ **Rich Metadata**: Shows office, source, date range, and author  
✅ **Better Organization**: Visual badges for priority, office, and source  
✅ **Multi-office Support**: Announcements from all offices displayed together  

## Testing the Integration

1. **Create an announcement** in Sub-announcements.html:
   - Navigate to the sub-admin panel
   - Go to Announcements section
   - Add a new announcement with title, description, dates, and priority

2. **View in chatbox**:
   - Open the main chatbot interface
   - Click the announcements button (megaphone icon)
   - Your announcement should appear with all metadata

3. **Verify data**:
   - Date range should show start and end dates
   - Office badge should display the office name
   - Source badge should show "Sub-Admin"
   - Priority badge should reflect the selected priority

## API Endpoints

- `GET /announcements` - Fetches all active announcements from MongoDB
- `GET /api/sub-announcements/list` - Lists announcements for specific office
- `POST /api/sub-announcements/add` - Creates new announcement
- `PUT /api/sub-announcements/update/<id>` - Updates existing announcement
- `DELETE /api/sub-announcements/delete/<id>` - Deletes announcement

## MongoDB Collections

- **sub_announcements** - Announcements created by sub-admins
- **admin_announcements** - Announcements created by admins + mirrored sub-admin announcements

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `chat.py` - Backend announcement fetching logic
2. ✅ `static/app.js` - Frontend rendering and display logic
3. ✅ `static/style.css` - Styling for new announcement elements

## Notes

- Announcements with `status: "active"` are displayed
- Announcements are sorted by priority first, then by date
- Empty state shows "No announcements available" message
- All announcements are fetched dynamically from MongoDB
- No static/hardcoded announcements remain in the system
