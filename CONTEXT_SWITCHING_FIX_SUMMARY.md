# Context Switching Fix - Summary

## üêõ Problem Identified

The context switching warning was not working because **the office context was never being stored** in the `user_contexts` dictionary after processing a message.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Detection was working**: The `detect_office_from_message()` function was correctly identifying offices from user messages

2. **Storage was missing**: After detecting an office, the code was:
   - Saving messages to MongoDB with the detected office ‚úÖ
   - BUT NOT storing the office in `user_contexts` dictionary ‚ùå

3. **Result**: When a user asked a second question about a different office:
   - Current office check: `current_office_tag = user_contexts[user].get('current_office')` ‚Üí **None** (never stored)
   - New office detected: `detected_office_tag` ‚Üí "registrar_office" ‚úÖ
   - Comparison: `None != "registrar_office"` ‚Üí **False** (no warning triggered)

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Change 1: Store Office Context After Processing Message

**File**: `app.py`  
**Location**: Lines 1831-1842  
**What was added**:

```python
# ‚úÖ STORE OFFICE CONTEXT: Update user_contexts with the detected office
if detected_office_tag:
    if user not in user_contexts:
        user_contexts[user] = {}
    elif not isinstance(user_contexts[user], dict):
        # Convert old string format to new dict format
        old_office = user_contexts[user]
        user_contexts[user] = {'current_office': old_office}
    
    # Store the current office context
    user_contexts[user]['current_office'] = detected_office_tag
    print(f"‚úÖ Stored office context for user '{user}': {detected_office} (tag: {detected_office_tag})")
```

### Change 2: Enhanced Debug Logging

**File**: `app.py`  
**Location**: Lines 1685-1690  
**What was added**:

```python
# Debug logging
print(f"üîç Context Switch Check:")
print(f"   User: {user}")
print(f"   Current office in context: {current_office_tag}")
print(f"   Detected office from message: {detected_office_tag}")
print(f"   User contexts: {user_contexts.get(user, 'Not set')}")
```

This helps you see exactly what's happening during context switch checks.

## üß™ How to Test the Fix

### Quick Test (2 minutes)

1. **Start your Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Run the verification script**:
   ```bash
   python verify_context_switch_fix.py
   ```

3. **Watch for**:
   - ‚úÖ "SUCCESS! Context switch warning is working!"
   - Debug logs in Flask console showing context being stored

### Manual Browser Test

1. Open the chatbot in your browser
2. Type: **"How can I enroll in TCC?"**
   - Watch Flask console: Should see `‚úÖ Stored office context for user 'guest': Admission Office`
3. Type: **"How do I request a transcript?"**
   - Should see: `‚ö†Ô∏è Office context switch detected: Admission Office ‚Üí Registrar's Office`
   - Chatbot should display warning message
   - Reset button should pulse with orange glow
4. Click **Reset Context** button
5. Type again: **"How do I request a transcript?"**
   - Should work normally now

## üîç Debug Logs to Watch For

When testing, you should see these logs in your Flask server console:

### On First Message (Admission):
```
üéØ Office detected: admission_office (score: 2)
üéØ Detected office: Admission Office
üîç Context Switch Check:
   User: guest
   Current office in context: None
   Detected office from message: admission_office
   User contexts: Not set
‚úÖ Stored office context for user 'guest': Admission Office (tag: admission_office)
```

### On Second Message (Different Office):
```
üéØ Office detected: registrar_office (score: 1)
üéØ Detected office: Registrar's Office
üîç Context Switch Check:
   User: guest
   Current office in context: admission_office
   Detected office from message: registrar_office
   User contexts: {'current_office': 'admission_office'}
‚ö†Ô∏è Office context switch detected: Admission Office ‚Üí Registrar's Office
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Context Switch Blocked ‚úÖ

```
User: "How can I enroll?"
Bot: [Responds with enrollment info]
Context: admission_office ‚úÖ STORED

User: "How do I get a transcript?"
Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Context Switch Warning
     "You're currently in the Admission Office context..."
Context: admission_office (unchanged)

User: [Clicks Reset]
Bot: "‚úÖ Admission Office context has been reset"
Context: None (cleared)

User: "How do I get a transcript?"
Bot: [Responds with transcript info]
Context: registrar_office ‚úÖ STORED
```

### Scenario 2: Same Office Continues ‚úÖ

```
User: "How can I enroll?"
Bot: [Responds]
Context: admission_office

User: "What are the requirements?"
Bot: [Responds normally - same office]
Context: admission_office

User: "When is the deadline?"
Bot: [Responds normally - same office]
Context: admission_office
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Warning Still Doesn't Appear:

1. **Check Office Detection**:
   - Look for `üéØ Office detected:` in Flask logs
   - If you see `(score: 0)` or no detection, the keywords might not match
   - Try more specific questions like "How do I enroll?" or "How do I get a transcript?"

2. **Check Context Storage**:
   - Look for `‚úÖ Stored office context` after first message
   - If missing, check that `detected_office_tag` is not None

3. **Check Context Comparison**:
   - Look at `üîç Context Switch Check:` logs
   - Verify "Current office in context" is not None on second message
   - Verify it's different from "Detected office from message"

4. **Restart Flask Server**:
   - The `user_contexts` dictionary is in-memory
   - Restart clears all contexts
   - Good for testing from scratch

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "General" office detected instead of specific office
- **Cause**: Keywords not matching
- **Fix**: Use exact phrases like "enroll", "transcript", "password reset"

**Issue**: Warning triggers on same office
- **Cause**: Different office tags for same office
- **Fix**: Check `office_tags` dictionary for consistency

**Issue**: Context persists after reset
- **Cause**: Reset endpoint not being called properly
- **Fix**: Check `/reset_context` endpoint response

## üìù Files Modified

| File | Lines | Change Description |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| `app.py` | 1831-1842 | Added code to store office context in `user_contexts` |
| `app.py` | 1685-1690 | Added debug logging for context switch checks |

## üéØ Key Points

‚úÖ **Context is now stored** after every message with a detected office  
‚úÖ **Debug logs added** to help trace the flow  
‚úÖ **No breaking changes** - backwards compatible with existing code  
‚úÖ **Works with all 5 offices** (Admission, Registrar, ICT, Guidance, OSA)  

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** using the verification script
2. **Monitor Flask logs** to see context being stored
3. **Test in browser** with real user interactions
4. **Verify reset functionality** works correctly
5. **Test with multiple users** to ensure isolation

## üìû Need Help?

If the fix still isn't working:

1. Share your Flask console logs (especially lines with üîç, üéØ, ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
2. Show the output from `verify_context_switch_fix.py`
3. Confirm you restarted the Flask server after making changes
4. Check that MongoDB is connected and working
