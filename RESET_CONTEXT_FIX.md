# Reset Context Fix - Summary

## 🐛 The Problem

After clicking "Reset Context", the context switching protection wasn't working. Users could still see warnings even after resetting.

### Root Cause

**TWO SEPARATE `user_contexts` DICTIONARIES!**

1. **`user_contexts` in `chat.py`** - Being reset by the `/reset_context` endpoint
2. **`user_contexts` in `app.py`** (line 1347) - Being used for context switch detection

These were **completely separate dictionaries**! So:
- Reset endpoint cleared the `chat.py` dictionary ✅
- But the `app.py` dictionary still had the old context ❌
- Context switch check used the `app.py` dictionary (still had old data) ❌
- Result: Warning still appeared even after reset! ❌

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Import Shared Context from chat.py

**File**: `app.py`, Lines 5-8

**Changed FROM**:
```python
from chat import (get_response, reset_user_context, clear_chat_history, 
                  get_active_announcements, add_announcement, get_announcement_by_id,
                  vector_store, get_chatbot_response, save_message)
```

**Changed TO**:
```python
from chat import (get_response, reset_user_context, clear_chat_history, 
                  get_active_announcements, add_announcement, get_announcement_by_id,
                  vector_store, get_chatbot_response, save_message,
                  user_contexts, office_tags, detect_office_from_message as chat_detect_office)
```

Now `user_contexts` and `office_tags` are **shared** from `chat.py` - single source of truth!

### Step 2: Remove Duplicate Definitions

**File**: `app.py`, Lines 1347-1355

**Removed**:
```python
user_contexts = {}  # Duplicate dictionary - REMOVED
office_tags = {     # Duplicate dictionary - REMOVED
   'admission_office': 'Admission Office',
   # ... etc
}
```

**Replaced with**:
```python
# ✅ IMPORTANT: user_contexts and office_tags are now imported from chat.py (single source of truth)
# This ensures reset_context works properly and context is shared across modules
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Reset Endpoint Logging

**File**: `app.py`, Lines 2199-2237

Added debug logging to trace reset operations:

```python
@app.post("/reset_context")
def reset_context():
    # ...
    print(f"🔄 Reset request - User: {user}, Office: {office}")
    print(f"🔍 Context before reset: {user_contexts.get(user, 'Not set')}")
    
    reset_user_context(user, office)  # Modifies shared user_contexts
    
    print(f"🔍 Context after reset: {user_contexts.get(user, 'Not set')}")
    # ...
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test Script

```bash
# Make sure Flask is running
python app.py

# In another terminal
python test_reset_context_fix.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ PASS: Context switch warning appeared!
✅ PASS: Context reset successful
✅ PASS: Switch allowed after reset!
✅ PASS: Context switch warning appeared again!

🎉 SUCCESS! All tests passed!
```

### Manual Browser Test

1. **Open chatbot in browser**

2. **Type**: `How can I enroll in TCC?`
   - Watch Flask console: `✅ Stored office context for user 'guest': Admission Office`

3. **Type**: `How do I request a transcript?`
   - Should see warning message
   - Reset button should pulse
   - Watch Flask console: `⚠️ Office context switch detected`

4. **Click "Reset Context" button**
   - Watch Flask console:
     ```
     🔄 Reset request - User: guest, Office: admission_office
     🔍 Context before reset: {'current_office': 'admission_office'}
     🔍 Context after reset: None  or  {'current_office': None}
     ✅ Context reset for user 'guest'
     ```

5. **Type**: `How do I request a transcript?`
   - Should work normally now (no warning)
   - Watch Flask console: `✅ Stored office context for user 'guest': Registrar's Office`

6. **Type**: `How do I reset my password?`
   - Warning should appear again (Registrar → ICT)
   - This confirms the system is working!

## 🔍 Debug Logs to Watch For

### After First Message:
```
🎯 Office detected: admission_office (score: 2)
🔍 Context Switch Check:
   User: guest
   Current office in context: None
   Detected office from message: admission_office
✅ Stored office context for user 'guest': Admission Office
```

### When Trying to Switch:
```
🎯 Office detected: registrar_office (score: 1)
🔍 Context Switch Check:
   User: guest
   Current office in context: admission_office
   Detected office from message: registrar_office
   User contexts: {'current_office': 'admission_office'}
⚠️ Office context switch detected: Admission Office → Registrar's Office
```

### When Resetting:
```
🔄 Reset request - User: guest, Office: admission_office
🔍 Context before reset: {'current_office': 'admission_office', ...}
🔄 No context found for user 'guest' - nothing to reset
   OR
✅ Reset office context: admission_office
🔍 Context after reset: None or {'current_office': None, ...}
✅ Context reset for user 'guest' - Office: Admission Office
```

### After Reset (New Query):
```
🎯 Office detected: registrar_office (score: 1)
🔍 Context Switch Check:
   User: guest
   Current office in context: None  ← Fixed! Was not None before
   Detected office from message: registrar_office
✅ Stored office context for user 'guest': Registrar's Office
```

## 📊 What Changed

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| `app.py` | 5-8 | Import `user_contexts`, `office_tags` from `chat.py` |
| `app.py` | 1347-1355 | Remove duplicate dictionary definitions |
| `app.py` | 2199-2237 | Enhanced reset endpoint with debug logging |

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

### Full Flow:

```
1. User: "How can I enroll?"
   → Bot responds
   → Context: {'current_office': 'admission_office'}

2. User: "How do I get a transcript?"
   → Bot: ⚠️ Warning message
   → Context: UNCHANGED (still admission_office)

3. User: [Clicks Reset]
   → Backend: Clears user_contexts[user]['current_office']
   → Context: {'current_office': None} or user removed from dict

4. User: "How do I get a transcript?"
   → Bot responds normally
   → Context: {'current_office': 'registrar_office'}

5. User: "How do I reset my password?"
   → Bot: ⚠️ Warning message (Registrar → ICT)
   → Works correctly!
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If reset still doesn't work:

1. **Restart Flask server** (crucial - changes take effect on restart)
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Check imports at top of app.py**
   - Verify line 8 has: `user_contexts, office_tags`

3. **Check no duplicate definitions**
   - Search app.py for `user_contexts = {` (should NOT exist except in comment)
   - Should only be imported, not defined

4. **Watch Flask console during reset**
   - Should see `🔍 Context before reset` and `🔍 Context after reset`
   - "After" should show None or empty

5. **Test with unique user ID**
   - Each test should use a new user ID
   - Or reset before starting test

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Context before reset" shows `Not set`
- **Cause**: Context was never stored
- **Fix**: Check that first message stored context (look for `✅ Stored office context`)

**Issue**: "Context after reset" still shows office
- **Cause**: `reset_user_context` in chat.py not working
- **Fix**: Check chat.py line ~788 for the reset function

**Issue**: Test script fails to connect
- **Cause**: Flask not running or wrong port
- **Fix**: Make sure Flask is on http://localhost:5000

## 📝 Key Points

✅ **Single source of truth** - Only one `user_contexts` dictionary (in chat.py)  
✅ **Shared import** - app.py imports the dictionary from chat.py  
✅ **Reset works** - Clearing the shared dictionary clears it everywhere  
✅ **Debug logs** - Easy to trace what's happening at each step  
✅ **No breaking changes** - Backwards compatible  

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The fix is working when:
1. ✅ Context is stored after first message
2. ✅ Warning appears when switching offices
3. ✅ Reset clears the context (visible in logs)
4. ✅ Switching works after reset (no warning)
5. ✅ New context is stored for new office
6. ✅ Warnings appear again for subsequent switches
