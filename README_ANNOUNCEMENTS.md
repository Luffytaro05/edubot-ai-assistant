1. Login at `/sub-index`
2. Go to "Announcements" page
3. Click "Add New Announcement"
4. Fill form and click "Save"
5. ✅ Done! Chatbot can now answer questions about it

### For Users (Asking Chatbot)

Ask the chatbot:
- "What are the latest announcements?"
- "Tell me about recent announcements"
- "Any announcements from the registrar?"
