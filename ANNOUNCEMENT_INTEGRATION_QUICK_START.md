3. **Create New Announcement**
   - Click "Add New Announcement" button
   - Fill in the form:
     - **Title**: Brief, descriptive title
     - **Content**: Detailed announcement message
     - **Start Date**: When announcement becomes active
     - **End Date**: When announcement expires
     - **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
     - **Status**: Active, Inactive, Draft, or Scheduled

4. **Save**
   - Click "Save" button
   - You'll see: "Announcement created successfully and synced to chatbot!"
   - ✅ Announcement is now stored in MongoDB
   - ✅ Announcement is indexed in Pinecone
   - ✅ Chatbot can now respond to queries about it

### For Users: Asking the Chatbot

Users can ask the chatbot about announcements:

**Example Queries:**
```
"What are the latest announcements?"
"Tell me about recent announcements"
"Any announcements from the registrar's office?"
"Show me high priority announcements"
"Are there any announcements about exams?"
"What's new?"
```

**Chatbot Response Example:**
```
📢 Relevant Announcements:

🔴 [HIGH] Final Exam Schedule Released
📍 Office: Registrar's Office
📅 Date: 2025-10-10
📝 The final examination schedule for Semester 1 is now available.
(Relevance: 95%)

🟡 [MEDIUM] Library Hours Extended
📍 Office: General
📅 Date: 2025-10-05
📝 The library will now be open until 10 PM on weekdays.
(Relevance: 87%)
```

## 📊 How It Works Behind the Scenes

### When You Create an Announcement:

```
1. Frontend sends data
   ↓
2. sub_announcements.py receives it
   ↓
3. Saves to MongoDB ✓
   ↓
4. Creates vector embedding using Sentence Transformers
   ↓
5. Stores in Pinecone ✓
   ↓
6. Links MongoDB record with Pinecone vector ID
   ↓
7. Mirrors to admin announcements collection
   ↓
8. Returns success message
```

### When User Asks Chatbot:

```
1. User: "What are the latest announcements?"
   ↓
2. Chatbot (chat.py) detects "announcements" intent
   ↓
3. Converts query to vector embedding
   ↓
4. Searches Pinecone for similar announcements
   ↓
5. Filters by: type="announcement" AND status="active"
   ↓
6. Ranks by relevance score (0-100%)
   ↓
7. Returns top 3 most relevant announcements
   ↓
8. Formats response with emojis and metadata
   ↓
9. User sees formatted announcement list
```

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Semantic Search

The system uses **semantic search**, not just keyword matching:

**Example:**
- User asks: "Tell me about exam information"
- System finds announcements containing: "examination", "test", "finals", "midterms"
- Even if exact word "exam" isn't in the announcement!

**How?**
- Uses Sentence Transformers model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Converts text to 384-dimensional vectors
- Finds similar meanings, not just matching words

### Office-Specific Filtering

Announcements are tagged with office information:
- Admission Office
- Registrar's Office
- ICT Office
- Guidance Office
- Office of Student Affairs

**Example:**
- User: "Any announcements from ICT?"
- Chatbot: Shows only ICT Office announcements

### Priority Ranking

Announcements are prioritized:
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Urgent, important
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Standard
- 🟢 **LOW** - General information

High priority announcements appear first in search results.

## 📝 Best Practices for Writing Announcements

### ✅ DO:

1. **Write Clear Titles**
   - ✅ Good: "Final Exam Schedule Released for Semester 1"
   - ❌ Bad: "Schedule"

2. **Provide Details**
   - Include dates, times, locations
   - Explain what students need to do
   - Add contact information if needed

3. **Use Keywords**
   - Include relevant terms students might search for
   - Example: "enrollment", "registration", "exam", "deadline"

4. **Set Appropriate Priority**
   - HIGH: Urgent deadlines, critical information
   - MEDIUM: Regular updates, reminders
   - LOW: General announcements

5. **Update End Dates**
   - Set realistic end dates
   - Expired announcements won't appear in chatbot responses

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't Be Vague**
   - ❌ "Important announcement"
   - ✅ "Tuition Payment Deadline Extended to Oct 15"

2. **Don't Skip Details**
   - Include: What, When, Where, Who, How
   - Don't assume students know the context

3. **Don't Forget to Set Status**
   - Drafts won't appear to users
   - Remember to set to "Active"

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Announcement not showing in chatbot

**Check:**
1. Status = "Active" ✓
2. End date is in the future ✓
3. Announcement was saved successfully ✓
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for Pinecone indexing ✓

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB
# Open MongoDB Compass or shell
db.sub_announcements.find({title: "Your Title Here"})

# Verify fields:
# - status: "active"
# - vector_id: should have a value
# - office: your office name
```

### Issue: Chatbot gives generic response

**Possible Causes:**
- Query doesn't match announcement content
- Relevance score too low (<60%)
- No announcements match the query

**Solution:**
- Try more specific queries
- Use keywords from announcement title/content
- Lower score threshold in `chat.py` (default: 0.6)

### Issue: "Announcement created" but not in database

**Check:**
1. MongoDB connection active
2. Session has valid office
3. No JavaScript console errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check server logs
# Look for:
"Announcement saved to MongoDB with ID: ..."
"Announcement stored in Pinecone with vector ID: ..."

# If you see errors, check:
# - MongoDB connection string
# - Pinecone API key
# - Network connectivity
```
